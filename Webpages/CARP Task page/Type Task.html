            <div class = "mediacontent-left">All the designs are centred along an axis with the intention of being symmetrical. The axis can be diagonal, off-centre or just in the middle. There is no restriction to how many axes you can have in one design. My design involves two parallel squares and text that stem from it. All key information is in bold. The design is not symmetrical which makes the squares more impactful and stand out without a drop shadow. The contrasting colour scheme of yellow and black makes the bold words in black more alluring to the eyes.</div>

            <div class = "mediacontent-left">The text forms a curve/arch/warp around a focal point. You could do this along an axis or make it appear as if itâ€™s going around a circle. My design uses the colour scheme of black and a pinkish hue. Once again, the drop shadow brings the numbers to the forefront. Around the curves of the numbers, I have details of the event and then along the axis I have the remaining information.</div>

            <div class = "mediacontent-left">Designed for ease of navigation the grid design has visible boundaries and margins that make it easier for a user to follow along the page. Text is usually the main and most important point, so visuals are usually included to fill up space within the grid. My grid design does just that. My grid is visibly 4x4 with the text running symmetrical of each other. I have a bar running down the right side which takes a 1/4 of the screen and is also accompanied by a circle that takes another 1/4 of the screen.</div>
