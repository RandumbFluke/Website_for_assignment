                <p>Bilateral System</p>
                <p>All the designs are centred along an axis with the intention of being symmetrical. The axis can be diagonal, off-centre or just in the middle. 
                There is no restriction to how many axes you can have in one design. My design involves two parallel squares and text that stem from it. All key information is in bold. 
                The design is not symmetrical which makes the squares more impactful and stand out without a drop shadow. 
                The contrasting colour scheme of yellow and black makes the bold words in black more alluring to the eyes.</p>

                <P>The text forms a curve/arch/warp around a focal point. You could do this along an axis or make it appear as if itâ€™s going around a circle. 
                My design uses the colour scheme of black and a pinkish hue. Once again, the drop shadow brings the numbers to the forefront. 
                Around the curves of the numbers, I have details of the event and then along the axis I have the remaining information.</P>

                <p>Grid Design</p>
                <p>Designed for ease of navigation the grid design has visible boundaries and margins that make it easier for a user to follow along the page. 
                Text is usually the main and most important point, so visuals are usually included to fill up space within the grid. My grid design does just that. 
                My grid is visibly 4x4 with the text running symmetrical of each other. 
                I have a bar running down the right side which takes a 1/4 of the screen and is also accompanied by a circle that takes another 1/4 of the screen.</p>

                <p>Modular Design</p>
                <p>Modular design incorporates shapes and illustrations to be a container for information. 
                My modular design involves black, blue and white as the colour scheme. The design runs centrally down the page using hollowed squares and filled circles, 
                this provides a patter/repetition.</p>

                <p>Radial Design</p>
                <p>Radial has a circular focal point with all the content radiating from either inside or outside. 
                My radial design has a mixture of text within the circle, but the majority is outside the circle. 
                This design incorporates a green and black colour scheme as well as drop shadows on two of the circles to bring them further to the forefront.</p>

        <div class = "random-section">

                <p>Random Design</p>
                <p>Random design has no arrangement but still remains visible for the user to interpret the required information. 
                My random design has scattered information that has a mix of colour, fonts, alignments and angles. The text is made to stand out more with the shapes free flowing along the page. 
                Some of the shapes have drop shadows, been distorted or they are not filled in.</p> 
            </div>

        <div class = "t-section">
            <img class = "typeimage" src = "TypeTaskPNG/Transitional Design.png">
            <div class= "mediacontent">
                <p>Transitional Design</p>
                <p>Lines of type may appear random but hierarchy within the lines of types help a user navigate the order it was intended to be seen in. 
                The transitional design can be compared to sedimentary layers of rock (strata). This design usually has text stand out more when accompanied by illustrations. 
                My transitional design incorporates colour contrast of red and black. 
                The shapes in the middle have been split and flow like a mountain side to reflect on the idea of transitional designs being similar to layers of rock. 
                The text is in a visible hierarchy when reading so it is easy to see the intended order of reading and key information has been made to be bold.</p>
