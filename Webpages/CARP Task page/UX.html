                <p>My users will be those interested in knowing about me and my experience/qualifications in this field. A few examples of this would be potential employers, classmates, family or the marker of my work. From this website I want to achieve a grade that reflects my ability and hopefully get feedback on how I could have improved the website to increase my abilities/qualifications. I want my first project to go well and have it function correctly to be used as a portfolio piece. I want to meet my goals as well as the potential goals of my users. This would be the criteria/mark scheme and ease of navigation, so users donâ€™t get confused when looking around my site.</p>
