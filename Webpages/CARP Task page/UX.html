                <p>My users will be those interested in knowing about me and my experience/qualifications in this field. A few examples of this would be potential employers, classmates, family or the marker of my work. From this website I want to achieve a grade that reflects my ability and hopefully get feedback on how I could have improved the website to increase my abilities/qualifications. I want my first project to go well and have it function correctly to be used as a portfolio piece. I want to meet my goals as well as the potential goals of my users. This would be the criteria/mark scheme and ease of navigation, so users don’t get confused when looking around my site.</p>

                <p>Scope</p>
                <p>My website will contain key content such as the CARP task, type task, coding sheets, UX task and the report. It will also include non-key elements such as my CV, cover letter, links to social media, contact information/about me page (this will include a personal statement as well as photograph of me). To accomplish this my website will need to be easy to navigate, this will be accomplished with a multipage website and a colour scheme to reflect each page is different. In addition to this, I hope to incorporate a sticky navigation bar to help move about the site as well as potentially having breadcrumbs navigation. This will allow the user to move back and forth easily and accessibly at any given time. </p>
