                <div class = "mediacontent-middle"><p>I began on any of my posters, I made a moodboard on what films mean to me, following this I picked my favourite themes and created posters around them. 
                Following this I completed a rough draft of each poster on graph paper to get a feel for the size and limitations of each piece. 
                This design was inspired by popcorn. As can be seen the True/False logo is part of the popcorn. 
                This was done via Adobe After Effects. This poster makes advantage of contrasting colours to allow for easy and visible text. 
                Important information is made eye-catching with the use of alignment, apparent in the bottom right of the poster. 
                The “Akira expanded” font of the “true/false festival” truly suggests the movie feel and guides the audience to know what the poster suggests at a glance.</p></div>
